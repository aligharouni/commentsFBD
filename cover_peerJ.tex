% Short version
% We provide more principled, curved-based statistics approaches to approximate the central set of an epidemic ensemble as a commentary on Juul et al.'s work (Nature Physics 17 (1): 5-8 doi: 10.1038/s41567-020-01121-y). We look forward to improving our article with your feedback.

Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit an original article entitled ``Functional boxplots for epidemic and other data: extensions of Juul \emph{et al.} (2021)'' for your consideration for publication in \journalname{}. This is an extending work on ``Fixed-time descriptive statistics underestimate extremes of epidemic curve ensembles", Juul et al. 2021 (Nature Physics 17 (1): 5-8 doi: 10.1038/s41567-020-01121-y). We have contacted the authors and sent them a copy of our commentary; the authors replied to our e-mail saying that they generally agreed with the points we made and did not have any concerns about submission.

We provide alternative, and more principled, curved-based statistics approaches to approximate the most central set which represents the central 90\% of the ensemble. In particular, we use two functional ranking methods: (1) the sampling-based, fast and robust functional boxplot, and (2) a multivariate generalization of ranking the curves by using Mahalanobis distance among features of interest. We apply our methods on the data set given by the authors and compare our results with theirs.

% All authors have approved the manuscript for submission and declare no competing interests. The manuscript has not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere; we have not previously discussed this submission with any editors at \journalname{}, except for a query about the open access options for commentaries.

Thank you very much for your consideration,
